    <p><strong>Here's a time line of Queen Dihya :</strong></p>
    <ul class="timeline">
      <li>Her birth name was Dihya, or some variant thereof (“the beautiful gazelle” in the Tamazight language of the Imazighen) while “Kahina” is an Arabic title meaning “prophetess” or “seer” or “witch”.</li><br>
      <li>She was born into the Jrāwa Zenata tribe in the early 7th century.</li><br>
      <li>Kahina was a Berber (Imazighen) warrior-queen and seer who led her people against the Arab Invasion of North Africa in the 7th century CE.</li><br>
      <li>She was the daughter (or niece) of the Berber king Aksel (died c. 688 CE, also known as Kusaila, Caecilius, Kusiela)</li><br>
      <li>For five years she ruled a free Berber state from the Aurès Mountains to the oasis of Gadames (695–700 CE).</li><br>
      <li>Dihya succeeded Kusaila as the war leader of the Berber tribes in the 680s and opposed the encroaching Arab Islamic armies of the Umayyad Dynasty</li><br>
      <li>She either died in battle, took poison to avoid capture, or was taken and later executed. Dates given for her death vary between 698, 702, and 705 CE, although the historical evidence suggests that the date of 698 CE is too early and her final battle was in either 702 or 705 CE.</li><br>
<li>Dihya reinforces contemporary Berber political aspirations and gives us a glimpse into the complex cultural and historical heterogeneity of North Africa.</li>
